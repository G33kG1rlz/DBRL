# DBRL Databricks Labs
*Repository for Databricks on GCP Labs from training events*

The contents of DBRL are organized by training event and contain the files necessary to run the labs  covered in the training. This is to allow participants to access the labs after the training. 
Each top level Event will contain an instruction sheet on how to install / setup the labs, but a prerequisite will be to have a running Databricks on GCP environment.
